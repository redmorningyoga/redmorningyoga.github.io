Welcome!🌞

I’m Reda, a certified yoga teacher passionate about helping people feel better in their bodies and minds - no matter your age or experience level.

After more than 7 years of personal practice, yoga has improved my life - helping me build strength, reduce stress, and move with more awareness. As I shared my love for yoga with friends, they encouraged me to take the next step and become a teacher. Their support inspired me to travel to Rishikesh, India, where I completed my Yoga Teacher Certification in February 2025.

Now, I offer warm, beginner-friendly yoga classes in Sydney, creating a welcoming space where everyone feels at ease — whether you’re brand new or returning to your mat.
